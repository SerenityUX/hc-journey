        I worked with Christina (HC Co-founder) & JC (fellow gap year) to make Pizza Grant! Christina had an existing connection with GitHub education. I worked a bit with her to make the pitch, but honestly she did all of the heavy-lifting with getting GitHub onboard. From there, I made a <a href="https://pizza.hackclub.com/">website</a>, some posters, and worked with JC to make a bot + review process.

        We've given out the pizza grant to over 200 clubs now! (that's over $20,000 worth of pizza). Learning how to distribute grants at a large scale like this while ensuring every grant goes to a teenager starting a Hack Club was a bit challenging, but I learned and I got a bunch of help from the HCB team.
        Club leaders are able to spend the funds on any group meal for their club (maybe that is Pizza, maybe it's not)

   Here's a video of Sahiti using the Pizza Grant @ her school in Georgia: <a href="https://youtu.be/xXIxwV7bQTw?feature=shared">https://youtu.be/xXIxwV7bQTw?feature=shared</a>

   I am super grateful to GitHub for funding this program! It was super helpful in inspiring a bunch of teenagers to start their own Hack Clubs.

   I think Hack Club can do better than giving away free pizza & I think we see that in Arcade & in the general YSWS.
