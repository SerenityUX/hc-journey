            Hey, Thomas here! I’m <span id="ageSpan"></span> years old (as of today), but as of writing this I am 19.78 years old. I joined Hack Club when I was 17 years old.
            <br/><br/>
            Over the past couple years, I made some decisions that will forever alter the course of my life! One of which was deciding to start a Hack Club at <a href="https://dhs.spart6.org/">my high school in South Carolina</a>... another was deciding to leave the country for the first time to go to <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/epoch">my first in-person hackathon</a>, and another being deciding to work at Hack Club for a year with my best friend (Dieter) instead of going to university.
            <br/><br/>
            On this page, you’ll get to hear about each one of these (& many more) adventures & decisions that I took over the past couple years. You’ll learn a bit about me, a bit about Hack Club, and a bit about what it’s like to take a gap year!
            <br/><br/>
            I’m now a Hack Club alum (I no longer work at Hack Club). I’ll still check the Slack from time to time & you’re always welcome to reach out <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2">@thomas</a>. I am grateful for all that Hack Club has offered me over the past couple years, and I am proud of the work I did to help Hack Clubbers discover the joy of building projects with their friends.
            <br/><br/>
