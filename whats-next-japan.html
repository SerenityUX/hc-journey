        Dieter & I are ending our gap year! I think the best thing I can do for Hack Club is to leave. My reasoning is that the core product that Hack Club creates is not our events, our clubs, or even projects teenagers build, but rather the people that come out of Hack Club and do awesome things for the world. The best endorcement of Hack Club is Dieter & I going out and making something awesome that stemmed from our start at Hack Club.

        Dieter & I been working together for the past 5 years (since Freshman Year of High School in our 9th grade media tech class). We're going to be moving to a rural cabin in Japan for a couple months that we found for a super cheap price. The rationale behind moving to this cabin in Japan is it is a place of isolation where we will have nothing but pure focus on our craft. We're going to be creating our next project in this cabin. My dream is to be able to create something that makes people's lives better and then to be able to live as a result of the product. Time will tell what that product looks like by the end of Japan. It will surely be an adventure (especially because I do not know Japanese).

        We'll check the Slack from time to time! Cya around :)
