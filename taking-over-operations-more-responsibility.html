        Holly left (on good terms)! Holly welcomed my club when I was in high school and I had been working with her for a few months. Holly & I were the only people working on the clubs team at the time, but when she left it was just me!

        This meant way more responsibility as I needed to do both clubs engineering but also clubs operations (welcoming all the new clubs & being their point of contact). Taking on this additional role was super helpful for me in feeling a full control over the clubs program. I think I rose to the challenge well and I enjoyed having more responsibility (even if it meant more work). I came up with a system where Sahiti & Arpan would help take some of the onboarding calls as a part-time remote role.

        I think club onboardings are done best when it's from one leader to another. I think being able to recount my personal experiences and anecdotes is much more helpful than general advice from someone who has never led a club. My approach to onboarding calls started as a direct copy of Holly's approach, but with time I bended it based on experiences from my Hack Club & from the clubs that I had talked to in other calls.
