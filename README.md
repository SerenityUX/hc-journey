# hack club journey!

Hey, Thomas here! As of writing this I am 19.81 years old. I joined Hack Club when I was 17 years old.

Over the past couple years, I made some decisions that will forever alter the course of my life! One of which was deciding to start a Hack Club at my high school in South Carolina... another was deciding to leave the country for the first time to go to my first in-person hackathon, and another being deciding to work at Hack Club for a year with my best friend (Dieter) instead of going to university.

On this page, you’ll get to hear about each one of these (& many more) adventures & decisions that I took over the past couple years. You’ll learn a bit about me, a bit about Hack Club, and a bit about what it’s like to take a gap year!

I’m now a Hack Club alum (I no longer work) at Hack Club. I’ll still check the Slack from time to time & you’re always welcome to reach out @thomas. I am grateful for all that Hack Club has offered me over the past couple years, and I am proud of the work I did to help Hack Clubbers discover the joy of building projects with their friends.
