            Dieter & I graduated high school, and then the morning after, I got in my 2001 Honda Odyssey mini-van (my mom's old car) and drove to Boston (about a 14 hour drive). Dieter took his Subaru and decided to come with to Angel Hacks & he brought his car because immediately after Angel Hacks we were moving to Vermont (he was going to be my roommate even though at the time he wasn't planning on working at Hack Club).

            I slept in my car near at a rest stop (keep in mind my car was stuffed full of everything I was taking from South Carolina to my soon to be new home in Vermont). We made it to Angel Hacks & I had a blast. Everyone was super friendly. I was working with my teammates to make an Elon Musk college admissions simulator. The concept behind the game was that you admit students and then GPT will see how the students you admit work together & in the end the university will get 10% of the student's lifetime earnings. It also cost $250k to admit each student but tutition was free. 
            <br/><br/>
            I think the game may have broken because of changes in the OpenAI API. Here's the link in case you're curious and wanna give it a shot: <a href="https://lemon-game.netlify.app/">https://lemon-game.netlify.app/</a>
            <br/><br/>
            Here's a documentary that Dieter made about the event: <a href="https://youtu.be/3J1Rz-3N1WQ?si=NYNbyAxgLjPYKHNt">https://youtu.be/3J1Rz-3N1WQ?si=NYNbyAxgLjPYKHNt</a>
            <br/><br/>
            Afterwards, I was incredible tired. We left the venue and Claire (organizer of the event) invited some folks from HQ over for dinner & invited me to join. I ended up falling asleep on the couch (I did not sleep at the hackathon) & then woke up a few hours later to drive to Vermont where I would start my new life. More on that in the next journey.
